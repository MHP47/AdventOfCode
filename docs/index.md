# Advent of Code

[https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Overview

I discovered Advent of Code in (I think) 2017. I was learning Python at the time and was looking for a project to apply the language to, as I have found this is the best way I learn new things, by _doing_ them.

That first year was a lot of fun, and I learnt a lot of Python coding during the month, which was the goal. Since then, I have attempted each year, with the goal of just completing challenges. I don't solve problems quick enough to place on the leaderboard, I think my best ever placing is low 200's. I'd love to one day place on the global leaderboard for just one star, so I'll keep trying

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo/website is many and varied

- It's a place for me to consolidate all my AoC code into one repo, and use this going forward, rather than the varied and adhoc nature I've been using
- Somewhere for me to reflect on the challenges and achievements along the way
- A showcase of what I can do
- Somewhere I can (hopefully) easily lookup previous years challenges when faced with that feeling of "This seems similar to something I've done before..."
- To review all my solutions, and complete all missing stars
