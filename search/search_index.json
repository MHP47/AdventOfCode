I was learning Python at the time and was looking for a project to apply the language to, as I have found this is the best way I learn new things, by doing them.</p> <p>That first year was a lot of fun, and I learnt a lot of Python coding during the month, which was the goal. Since then, I have attempted each year, with the goal of just completing challenges. I don't solve problems quick enough to place on the leaderboard, I think my best ever placing is low 200's. I'd love to one day place on the global leaderboard for just one star, so I'll keep trying</p>"},{"location":"#purpose","title":"Purpose","text":"<p>The purpose of this repo/website is many and varied</p> <ul> <li>It's a place for me to consolidate all my AoC code into one repo, and use this going forward, rather than the varied and adhoc nature I've been using</li> <li>Somewhere for me to reflect on the challenges and achievements along the way</li> <li>A showcase of what I can do</li> <li>Somewhere I can (hopefully) easily lookup previous years challenges when faced with that feeling of \"This seems similar to something I've done before...\"</li> <li>To review all my solutions, and complete all missing stars</li> </ul>"}]}
